# BGL
BGL is a project which aims to help in the analysis of matches for players and their leagues for tabletop games.
Currently, the functionality is limited to creating basic records and being able to see them. 

In the future, the goal is to have a sort of user/league system, pre-built score templates for users to fill in (or some sort of template generation), and global statistics.

#### Running
Simply clone the repository, install all packages in requirements.txt, then execute "flask run".
